# Due date: Sunday April 7th before midnight
# Write your answers in the space between the questions, and commit/push only this file to your repo.
# Note that there can be a difference between giving a "minimally" right answer, and a really good
# answer, so it can pay to put thought into your work.

# Part 1: Introductory Python (to be done without defining functions or classes)

# Question 1.1: Using a for loop, write code that takes in any list of objects, then prints out:
# "The value at position __ is __" for every element in the loop, where the first blank is the
# index location and the second blank the object at that index location.


# Question 1.2: A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same both forwards and backwards. Write
# code that takes a variable of any string, then tests to see whether it qualifies as a palindrome.
# Make sure it counts the word "radar" and the phrase "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", while
# rejecting the word "Microsoft" and the phrase "This isn't a palindrome". Print the results of these
# four tests.


# Question 1.3: The code below pauses to wait for user input, before assigning the user input to the
# variable. Beginning with the given code, check to see if the answer given is an available
# vegetable. If it is, print that the user can have the vegetable and end the bit of code.  If
# they input something unrecognized by our list, tell the user they made an invalid choice and make
# them pick again. Repeat until they pick a valid vegetable.
available_vegetables = ['carrot', 'kale', 'broccoli', 'pepper']
choice = input('Please pick a vegetable I have available: ')


# Question 1.4: Write a list comprehension that starts with any list of strings and returns a new
# list that contains each string in all lower-case letters, unless the modified string begins with
# the letter "a" or "b", in which case it should drop it from the result.


# Question 1.5: Beginning with the two lists below, write a single dictionary comprehension that
# turns them into the following dictionary: {'IL':'Illinois', 'IN':'Indiana', 'MI':'Michigan', 'WI':'Wisconsin'}
short_names = ['IL', 'IN', 'MI', 'WI']
long_names  = ['Illinois', 'Indiana', 'Michigan', 'Wisconsin']

# Part 2: Functions and classes (must be answered using functions\classes)

# Question 2.1: Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments, then
# sums them together. If the sum is greater than 10, return the string 
# "big", if it is equal to 10, return "just right", and if it is less than
# 10, return "small". Apply the function to each tuple of values in the 
# following list, with the end result being another list holding the strings 
# your function generates (e.g. ["big", "big", "small"]).

start_list = [(10, 0), (100, 6), (0, 0), (-15, -100), (5, 4)]



# Question 2.2: The following code is fully-functional, but uses a global
# variable and a local variable. Re-write it to work the same, but using one
# argument and no global variable. Use no more than two lines of comments to
# explain why this new way is preferable to the old way.

a = 10
def my_func():
    b = 40
    return a + b
x = my_func()


# Question 2.3: Write a function that can generate a random password from
# upper-case and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters 
# (!@#$%^&*). It should have an argument for password length, and should 
# check to make sure the length is between 8 and 16, or else print a 
# warning to the user and exit. Your function should also have a keyword 
# argument named "special_chars" that defaults to True.  If the function 
# is called with the keyword argument set to False instead, then the 
# random values chosen should not include special characters. Create a 
# second similar keyword argument for numbers. Use one of the two 
# libraries below in your solution:
#import random
#from numpy import random
  
  
# Question 2.4: Create a class named MovieDatabase that takes one argument
# when an instance is created which stores the name of the person creating
# the database (in this case, you) as an attribute. Then give it two methods:
#
# The first, named add_movie, that requires three arguments when called: 
# one for the name of a movie, one for the genera of the movie (e.g. comedy, 
# drama), and one for the rating you personally give the movie on a scale 
# from 0 (worst) to 5 (best). Store those the details of the movie in the 
# instance.
#
# The second, named what_to_watch, which randomly picks one movie in the
# instance of the database. Tell the user what to watch tonight,
# courtesy of the name of the name you put in as the creator, using a
# print statement that gives all of the info stored about that movie.
# Make sure it does not crash if called before any movies are in the
# database.
#
# Finally, create one instance of your new class, and add four movies to
# it. Call your what_to_watch method once at the end.
